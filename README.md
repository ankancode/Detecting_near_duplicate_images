# Detecting_near_duplicate_images
## Duplicate Defination :  
I have defined duplicates as near duplicates images based on following criteria- 
1) If images are exactly same.
2) If they are similar in the sense that they are same tops but they have some minor image or color differences in the top then it must be detected. 
3) If a same top is worn by a different model and also if the model is standing in a different pose in the same dress then it must be detected.  
4) If the same image is cropped at different portion or if the resolution of the images are different or if it has some noise in the image then also it must be detected.
